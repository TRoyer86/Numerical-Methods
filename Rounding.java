Assignment 1: Rounding
Windows 10
Included files: Rounding.java

PURPOSE: The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the effects of rounding
and truncation errors on accuracy.

INPUT: The data used as input to demonstrate error is an h value (see code) that
starts at a value of 1 and ends once it becomes less than 2.0e-12.

OUTPUT: The output of the program includes the present value of h, the
approximation of the derivative, and the amount of error between the true 
value of the derivative and the approximation.

ALGORITHM: To find the approximate derivative, begin with an initial value of h.
Plug that value of h into the difference equation.
The output of that difference equation is the approximation of the derivative
    for that particular value of h.
Find the error by subtracting the approximation from the real value of the 
    derivative.
Divide h in half.
Repeat until h is sufficiently small.
